Bootstrap your next Node.js serverless microservice project with a lightweight template for Serverless Framework.

> **NOTE:** This is not an introduction to the Serverless Framework. You would already need to know how Serverless Framework works prior to using of this template.

Lesgo! provides the template (with examples) to quickly build any project from simple REST endpoint(s) to a complex API microservice.
